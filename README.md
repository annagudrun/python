#Down-load clean-Up

##How to use the script:
1. Run sortDirectory.py
2. User is then asked to enter the absolute path to the root directory containing the downloads folder
3. User now has to enter search string that can include dots, commas or be a substring in the filename.
4. Then, user chooses a name to store the files.
5. The script sorts all tv-shows under the folder "Shows" and deletes any empty folders and useless files that are left.

If subtitles exist for tv-shows, they will be moved along with the video files.

Example:

Enter full path to folder: Downloads
Invalid path, try again
Enter full path to folder: /Users/thorgerdur/Desktop/verk4/python/sortDirectory.py
Name of show: Desperate Housewifes
Name of folder: Despo
